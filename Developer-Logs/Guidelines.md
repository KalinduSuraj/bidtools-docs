# Developer Daily Log Guidelines

Each developer must create a daily log file using the format:

[developer-name]-[DD-MMM].md

Example:
ahmed-01-Jan.md

Daily log should include:
- Tasks completed today
- Tasks in progress
- Blockers/issues
- Notes or plans for next day

Folder structure:
Developer-Logs/2025/Jan/

At the end of each month, logs may be moved to:
Developer-Logs/archive/
